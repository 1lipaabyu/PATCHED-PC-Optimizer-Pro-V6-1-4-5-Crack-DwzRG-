*WebScrapBook* is a browser addon that captures the web page faithfully with various archive formats and customizable configurations.

A wab page can be saved as a folder, a zip-packed archive file (HTZ or MAFF), or a single HTML file (optionally scripted as an enhance). An archive file can be viewed by opening the index page after unzipping, using the built-in archive page viewer, or with other [assistant tools](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook/wiki/View).

Besides, a site indexer is also built in and can be used to [generate a static site](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook/wiki/Indexer) for the captured web pages. Additionally, the [data folder of legacy ScrapBook (X) can be imported](https://github.com/danny0838/webscrapbook/wiki/Import) using the indexer.

This extension is available for Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, etc.), and Firefox for Desktop and Android.
