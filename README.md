*Web ScrapBook* is a browser addon that captures the web page with highly customizable configurations.

A wab page can be saved as a folder, a single HTML file, or a zip-packed archive file (.htz or .maff). An archive file can be viewed via the built-in "View archive page" feature (it's recommended that *"Allow access to file URLs" be checked* to allow viewing an archive file in the local filesystem directly), or by opening the entry page after unzipping.

This extension is available for Chromium-based browsers (Google Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi, etc), and Firefox for Desktop and Android.


## Caveats:
* Several features may not work correctly in a private window in Firefox.
* "Allow access to file URLs" is not supported in Firefox.
* A vary large zip archive file (around 2 GiB) cannot be read by the browser. A large file in the zip archive (around 400~500 MiB) can exhaust the memory and crash the extension.
* Javascripts and objects may not work correctly and has a potential security risk in the archive page viewer.
