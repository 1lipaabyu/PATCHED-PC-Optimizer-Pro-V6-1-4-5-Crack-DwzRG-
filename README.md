*WebScrapBook* is a browser extension that captures the web page faithfully with various archive formats and customizable configurations, for future retrieval, organization, annotation, and editing. This project inherits from legacy Firefox add-on [ScrapBook X](https://github.com/danny0838/firefox-scrapbook).

This extension is available for Chromium-based browsers ([Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scrapbook/oegnpmiddfljlloiklpkeelagaeejfai), [Edge](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/lodlipoddpmffbngkadebncbbidnambc), Opera, Vivaldi, etc.), and [Firefox for Desktop and Android](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/webscrapbook).

> For Firefox, many add-ons are encountering a severe delay to get a signature recently as Mozilla is changing the add-on reviewing protocal (see [related threads on the official forum ](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/add-ons/addons-mozilla-org/109) for more details). Consider [installing as an unsigned add-on](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox#w_what-are-my-options-if-i-want-to-use-an-unsigned-add-on-advanced-users) as a workaround.
